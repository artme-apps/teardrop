## YouTube Videos
I've seen some people making videos about my ransomware project. This is fine and all but they dont link to the correct repo, isntead they link forks that dont get updated. If you do make a video make sure to link hackthedev/teardrop, as this is the original and up-to-date version. You can also link your own fork of course. Its just so that new users get a better experience and dont have to deal with outdated forks of this project.

<br>

## Updates?
I've planned to keep updating this project and fixing bugs. If you've found any bug, you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/hackthedev/teardrop/issues). There might be updates where I only cleaned up the Code. It is planned to also implement new Features. If you want to stay up-to-date, follow me on Github.
